# IEEE_GUC_SB-Batman-vs-Superman-login-system
The project is a registration system with different user types (Superman Lover, Neutral user and Batman lover). When a user logs in he/she will be presented with the list of different users in the database with the ability to view the profile of each one keeping in mind that every user type will have a different profile template.
